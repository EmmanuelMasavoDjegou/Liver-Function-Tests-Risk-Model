## Overview

This project introduces a **data-driven Liver Function Tests (LFTs) Calculator** designed to improve mortality risk prediction and support actionable underwriting decisions. The tool translates statistical model outputs into expert-validated life ratings, enhancing underwriting efficiency.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Fast and easy to use**  
- Captures **complex interactions** between multiple liver enzymes  
- Provides **high explainability**, essential for clinical and insurance decision-making

## Background

Life rating is the process of assessing an individual‚Äôs health and mortality risk based on clinical data. This study analyzed data from U.S. life insurance applicants, focusing on five liver enzymes:

- Alanine Transaminase (ALT)  
- Aspartate Transaminase (AST)  
- Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)  
- Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)  
- Total Bilirubin

A notable finding was a **U-shaped relationship** between ALT levels and mortality risk. After adjusting for other enzymes, the relationship shifted: **lower ALT was linked to higher risk**, while higher ALT was associated with **lower risk**, a pattern primarily influenced by AST.

---

## Approach

The life rating strategy integrates data science with clinical expertise through three steps:

1. **Model Prediction:** Estimate mortality risk and generate a risk score for each applicant.  
2. **Expert Rating:** Apply human judgment to assign life ratings based on clinical knowledge.  
3. **Score Mapping:** Define cut-off thresholds to translate model risk scores into standardized manual life ratings.

These cut-offs serve as a critical link, making complex model outputs actionable and aligned with underwriting practice.

## Impact

This innovative approach supports Reinsurance Group of America‚Äôs goal to:

- Drive underwriting efficiency  
- Use statistical models (notably generalized linear models, GLMs) to enhance life rating accuracy  
- Maintain explainability for trust and adoption in both clinical and actuarial settings
